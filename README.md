# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

"""
This code implements a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for data clustering.
The GMM is a probabilistic model that represents the data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
It is commonly used for tasks such as clustering, density estimation, and data generation.

The GMM assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of K Gaussian distributions,
where each data point is associated with one of the K components.
The model parameters include the means, covariances, and mixture weights of the Gaussian components.

This code provides functions for training the GMM using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm,
as well as functions for predicting the cluster assignments of new data points.

# Model Representation:

In a GMM, each cluster is represented by a Gaussian distribution. The GMM assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of these Gaussian distributions.

Parameters:

* The model has parameters for each Gaussian distribution, including mean, covariance matrix, and weight. The weight represents the proportion of data points assigned to each cluster, and the sum of weights across all clusters is equal to 1.

Assignment of Data Points:

* Each data point is probabilistically assigned to each cluster based on the likelihood of it being generated by each Gaussian distribution. The model calculates the probability of a data point belonging to each cluster.

Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm:

* The parameters of the GMM are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm iteratively performs two steps:
Expectation (E-step): Given the current parameters, calculate the probability of each data point belonging to each cluster.
Maximization (M-step): Update the parameters (mean, covariance, and weight) based on the assigned probabilities.

Cluster Centers and Shapes:

* The mean and covariance of each Gaussian distribution represent the center and shape of the clusters. The covariance matrix accounts for the shape and orientation of the cluster.

Number of Clusters:

* The number of clusters in the GMM is specified beforehand or determined through techniques like cross-validation or information criteria. The model can capture complex structures in the data, and each cluster is represented by a Gaussian distribution.
